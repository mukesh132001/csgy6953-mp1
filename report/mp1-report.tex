\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
    A model with ResNet architecture and less than 5 million trainable parameters is
    herein designed for the task of image classification.
    The model is trained and evaluated on the CIFAR-10 dataset, which contains very
    small images across ten classes.
\end{abstract}

\section{Overview}

The goal of this
This is some introductory text.
Talk about the problem statement and background on ResNet and CIFAR .

Make sure to cite the ResNet\cite{dblp:2015} paper.

Cite the repository\cite{kl:2021} from which code was adapted.

Describe the process and summarize the findings.

\section{Methodology}

Here we will describe the methodology.

Be sure to mention training parameters such as data augmentation.

Initial model design and selection.
This involved comparing results of training with relatively few epochs, across different layer structures and optimizers.

Then we took the best of those models and trained it for longer
and with a variety of learning rate scheduling strategies.
What we saw was that we could achieve good performance, in terms of
accuracy on the validation set, but the model was obviously overfitting.
The training loss would become saturated, with accuracy on the training
set at greater than 99 percent.
With such low loss, there is little signal to provide to update the weights.
Validation improvements after saturation are likely random fluctuations (noise).

So we decided to introduce some regularization strategies during training.
We considered different values for weight decay and different dropout strategies.

We evaluated again with those, and saw that training was not getting saturated so
early, so we took the most promising among those strategies and selected it for
our final model design.

We then trained that model for a large number of epochs, stopping training when
loss because saturated.

We show the plots of loss/accuracy on training and validation sets.

\section{Results}

Here, discuss the results of evaluating the fully-trained final model on the test dataset.
Describe the CIFAR test dataset.
